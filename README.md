# Hospital-Assistive Remote-Controlled (RC) Car with Gearbox Control

This project is an Arduino-powered RC car designed to assist in hospital environments. It features:

- A custom-designed **3D-printed gearbox** with high, low, neutral, and reverse gears
- Remote control using a **joystick module** and **IR remote**
- **Obstacle detection** using an ultrasonic sensor and **buzzer alert system**
- A rear **storage compartment** for transporting small items
- Powered by a **12V DC motor**, controlled via an **L298N motor driver**

## Files
- `RC_Car_Project.ino` â€” Arduino code for controlling the car and integrating sensor input

## Hardware Components
- Arduino Uno  
- L298N Motor Driver  
- Servo motor (for steering control)  
- Joystick + IR Remote  
- Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)  
- XD-3420 DC Motor  
- Buzzer  

## Features
- Stops automatically when an obstacle is detected within 10 cm
- Combines manual gear shifting with automated motor control
- Designed for safe, assistive movement in hospital corridors
